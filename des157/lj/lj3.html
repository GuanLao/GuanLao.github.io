                    Reading <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing photographs to teach close reading and visual thinking skills </a> by Michael Gonchar. I learned that photographs are without a doubt one of the most important inventions in the 1800s. It helps us understand and brings us back in time, more importantly, it delivers hidden messages that require the viewer to solve. Photography tells a million stories, and everyone has their own perspective of looking at the photograph. Different cultural backgrounds may influence how someone would interpret the picture. One thing that he said was to “be a detective”, which is a skill you need when interpreting a picture. Notice the details, every detail is important in bringing the message to life. People in this era are constantly fighting with time, we are always rushing through everything. We need to know when to slow down and start paying attention to things around us such as a simple thing such as interpreting a photograph.
                    Also don’t be afraid to ask open ended questions, such as why is the photographer taking the picture in this perspective and what are the people doing in this picture. All of these clues are important in finding the final meaning.
