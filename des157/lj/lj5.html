                As someone who plays a lot of video games and mobile games. I found this <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">article by Amiri Dori</a> super interesting and relatable. When I play games, I don't
                really pay much attention to the placement of every button and the reason behind it. But all I knew was that the buttons are always right where they are supposed to be. Now after reading this article, I discovered the comfort to reach
                and hard to reach area on mobile games which make a lot of sense. According to how people hold their phone, the most comfortable spot is near the button and that is why most of the call to action buttons are at the button. In addition,
                how UX designers can control our mind is just amazing. For example, UX designers place the button they donâ€™t want us to click on the left and the button they want us to pick on the right. This little trick has been working as a charm.
                For some reason now, even if I get blindfolded I would guess the next or forward button would always be on the lower right and quit at the lower left. These are just good user experiences that we need to observe to learn.
