                    At first glance at the top image, it is obvious that this cake is homemade. But the hidden message of this image is that it was my first time baking a cake for my father's birthday. It was during the period of Covid so we didn't want to take the risk of going out to buy a cake so I made this matcha cake with fruit on top to celebrate his birthday.
                    
                    My original theme is on a car show but now I change it to the theme of "First time". I will be gathering pictures that tell my first time. This image relates to my topic because it was my first time baking a cake. I might use this image as one of my collections too. At the bottom, this is an image of a Urus Lamborghini. I took this picture at my first car show, this car is my favorite car in the entire car collection of the night for obvious reasons.

                    As for Sally's images. She had a very interesting approach. She took images of the seed she planted which she used as her cooking ingredient. The images are interesting because it is a step process, seeing it grow from a seed to plant than to a delicious plate of food. The obvious aspect of the image is that it is a skill of gardening but the hidden aspect is that it can also be turned into food!
