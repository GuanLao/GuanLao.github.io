                    At first glance at the top image, it is obvious that this cake is homemade. But the hidden message of this image is that it was my first time baking a cake for my father's birthday. It was during the period of Covid so we didn't want to take the risk of going out to buy a cake so I made this matcha cake with fruit on top to celebrate his birthday.
                    
                    My original theme is on a car show but now I change it to the theme of "First time". I will be gathering pictures that tell my first time. This image relates to my topic because it was my first time baking a cake. I might use this image as one of my collections too.

                    As for Sally's images, She took picture of a sunset and the hidden message for this image is that sunset symbolizes the comepletion of a cycel and an end to a day. The beauty of a sunset also bring her calmness and  a sense of warmness which she greatly desire. I agreed with her point of view, whenever I see a sunset, it symbolize the end of a day no matter if it's a good or bad day. Also symbolizing a new day will be coming with sunrise where people need to start their day strong and the cycle repeats as the sunset again.
