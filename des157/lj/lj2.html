                    Reading through the article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c?gi=57d24d34efa">Best Practice for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows </a> by
                    Naema Baskanderi make me realize the importance of modals and their impact. I learned so much,
                    I didn’t realize a simple interaction I see almost every day has so many different elements to it. 
                    Also, it is true when she said it is used to grab the user’s attention. As users, our attention goes 
                    straight to whatever pops up on our screen and this is the perfect way to grab the user’s attention. In addition, 
                    I agreed with the scale she mentioned, if the modal is too big it can be too dominant and take our attention away 
                    from the main page, in this case, might as well make a different page. One thing that I didn't pay attention to was 
                    the dark background whenever a modal pop up. Darkening the background is so effective in switching our attention from 
                    the main page to the modal indicating that we cannot interact with the main page without filling out the modal or clicking 
                    cancel or escape. Overall, I learned a lot from reading this article, and I feel like we take a lot of these designs for granted 
                    and did not realize the amount of user testing was done to figure the perfect format or the element displayed in the article.
