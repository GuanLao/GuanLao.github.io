            Reading through the article “Best Practice for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows” by
             Naema Baskanderi make me realize the importance of modals and their impact. I learned so much,
              I didn’t realize a simple interaction I see almost every day has so many different elements to it. 
              Also, it is true when she said it is used to grab the user’s attention. As users, our attention goes 
              straight to whatever pops up on our screen and this is the perfect way to grab the user’s attention. In addition, 
            I agreed with the scale she mentioned, if the modal is too big it can be too dominant and take our attention away 
            from the main page, in this case, might as well make a different page. One thing that I didn't pay attention to was 
            the dark background whenever a modal pop up. Darkening the background is so effective in switching our attention from 
            the main page to the modal indicating that we cannot interact with the main page without filling out the modal or clicking 
            cancel or escape. Overall, I learned a lot from reading this article, and I feel like we take a lot of these designs for granted 
            and did not realize the amount of user testing was done to figure the perfect format or the element displayed in the article.

     After reading through the article “Best Practices for form design” by Salim Ansari. 
        I agreed and can relate to a lot of things he mentioned in his article. The theory of 
        “less is more” can’t be more true. Sometimes when I’m taking a form or survey and if 
        there are way too many questions, I would start to get frustrated.
        Also, I love the idea 
        of multiple steps because when I’m filling out a form. I would like to see when I would reach the end,
         if the form just went down endlessly, I would most likely leave the page. However, if the page provides 
         clear pictures or logos that indicate which step I’m on then I would feel much better and would most likely go on.
          Ansari also points out that including asterisks are crucial and I believe that is true too. 
          Since the asterisk is red, it catches the user’s attention. When I see an asterisk,
           I would read the question more carefully, because it is usually something important.
            Explaining the format requirement is another crucial point. Based on the create password 
            example Ansari provided, if the requirement is already there then the user would know what 
            requirement they need to include in their password. Vice versa, if there is no information 
            regarding the password then I would not know what I need to include in my password and most 
            likely that I would get an error message. Overall, this is a very interesting article to read 
            and definitely gave me some idea on what to do and not to do in my Mad Libs.

        <p>Google is without the doubt one of the most user friendly website since they did hundreds of user testing themselves.
            For example when you <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp">sign up an account </a> with google, the informations they require from you are clearly stated in placeholder text.
            They are the definition of what is "less is more", the process of creating an account is so easy, a non-digital literate person can easily
            navigate through this process.
