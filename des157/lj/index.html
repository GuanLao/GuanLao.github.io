                    After reading through the article <a href ="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f?gi=91f07d97283c">Best Practices for form design </a> by Salim Ansari. 
                    I agreed and can relate to a lot of things he mentioned in his article. The theory of 
                    “less is more” can’t be more true. Sometimes when I’m taking a form or survey and if 
                    there are way too many questions, I would start to get frustrated.
                    Also, I love the idea 
                    of multiple steps because when I’m filling out a form. I would like to see when I would reach the end,
                    if the form just went down endlessly, I would most likely leave the page. However, if the page provides 
                    clear pictures or logos that indicate which step I’m on then I would feel much better and would most likely go on.
                    Ansari also points out that including asterisks are crucial and I believe that is true too. 
                     Since the asterisk is red, it catches the user’s attention. When I see an asterisk,
                    I would read the question more carefully, because it is usually something important.
                    Explaining the format requirement is another crucial point. Based on the create password 
                    example Ansari provided, if the requirement is already there then the user would know what 
                    requirement they need to include in their password. Vice versa, if there is no information 
                    regarding the password then I would not know what I need to include in my password and most 
                    likely that I would get an error message. Overall, this is a very interesting article to read 
                    and definitely gave me some idea on what to do and not to do in my Mad Libs.

                <p>Google is without the doubt one of the most user friendly website since they did hundreds of user testing themselves.
                    For example when you <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp">sign up an account </a> with google, the informations they require from you are clearly stated in placeholder text.
                    They are the definition of what is "less is more", the process of creating an account is so easy, a non-digital literate person can easily
                    navigate through this process.
