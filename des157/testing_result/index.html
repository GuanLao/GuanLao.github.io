        <h2>
            Julia
        </h2>
        <p>
            Julia thinks the info button help alot especially for people that are not as familiar to Naruto. She likes the definition given to the user, it is very clear and direct. She thinks the texts are not too heavy and just about right amount of text but the
            font could be a bit biger as it is a little hard to read espically when put on projector. She thinks the wording on the navbar "Your way" is a little confusing for her so she suggests that I find another word in replace of it. Julia also thinks
            adding a hover feedback on the info button will help guide user that it is clickable and changing the cursor to a pointer would also help alot. Lastly, the picture for "land of lighting" has a bad contrast as it is harder to see.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Pratibha
        </h2>
        <p>
            Pratibha thought the page was very interesting even to someone that is not familiar to Naruto. She really likes the graphics and font, and like the information given. She likes the drop down as it eliminate typo. She also suggest to change the cursor
            when user hover over the navbar and info button for better user experience. Some other suggestion from her is to anime the ball in the result scene and maybe add a portal effect or another overlay to introduce the game before people dive in
            to it.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Miguel
        </h2>
        <p>
            Miguel as a big fan of Naruto also like the page alot. He love the interface, font are very accurate and the info button help alot as well. But some spacing were a bit off and also suggest to change the cursor when hover on navbar or anything that is
            clickable. I asked if the "your way" make sense to the viewer and Miguel says it make sense to him. Lastly, he suggest to change the background acccording to the option user chose.
        </p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h2>
            My Plan
        </h2>
        <p>
            I got alot of great feedback from this user testing session. This is super helpful, I think this is more useful than the group feedback that we had. From all the feedback I got, I am definitely going to fix the spacing and change the cursor in the hover
            state. Also, I will play around with the font size to make sure it is readable for the user. I am still think whether or not to change the wording in the navbar. I was plannng to change it but Miguel says it make sense to him. I think I will
            keep the way it is right now until I think of a better replacement.
