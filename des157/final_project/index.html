                    <p>
                        The user kneads chakra in their body and turns it into fire, which they then expel from their mouth; the more chakra they use, the more flames that are produced. Sometimes the flames lack a distinct shape, being only a stream, but more often than not
                        they take the form of a giant orb that maintains its shape until hitting a target.

                        This jutsu allows the user to create one or more copies of themselves. The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's
                        chakra, and so on. (Great for mutitasking ^.^)

                        The Summoning Technique allows the user to transport a target to their location. Before an animal can be summoned, a prospective summoner must first form a contract with the animal and/or its species. In the case of the toads, the contract is a scroll
                        that the summoner signs their name to using their own blood.
